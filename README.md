### Market Survey:
There are few games whose general idea is similar but do not go into details like David - Dawn Of A King, The Campaigns of King David (Board Game). These games do not talk about the history of the Jewish people and do not tell the stories of King David from the Bible. Our game will focus on those historical stories
